    <!-- Config for AVD showing that shots are below. Morph from the shots icon (mountains)
         to a down arrow (with a bounce) then back.

         Actually we morph from the mountains to an up arrow + a 180ยบ rotation then swap this
         instantaneously for a down arrow and morph that back to the mountains.
         Cus it looks cool. -->
