    <!-- Describes an animation of the share icon.
         Totally inspired by (stolen from) http://j-scott.com/work/#/span2015/

         Animate between three states:
           1. collapsed (single dot)
           2. mid expand (center to top left)
           3. full (standard share icon)

         Each state has to draw all 5 shapes (3 circles & 2 lines) so that path morphing works
         (even when all paths are overlapping like in the collapsed state). We use 2 path objects as
         the dots are filled while the lines are stroked. I guess I could have used filled
         rectangles but whatever; I drew lines in Sketch :p -->
